Armed with engineer reports and recommendations, they’ll hold public hearings to determine which roads to fix, which to replace and which to put on next year’s wish list.</p><p>As with past budgets, the vast array of road projects demanding immediate attention will likely exceed the funds available to fix them. And there won’t be much additional help from the state. The two-year budget adopted by state lawmakers in May ($5.5 billion over two years) essentially kept transportation funding at current levels.</p><p>Traditionally, transportation experts here and elsewhere have relied on and called for bids from asphalt contractors. Asphalt, a byproduct of oil, was considerably cheaper than concrete for many years. Since 1999, however, the price of asphalt increased 120 percent while the price of concrete went up a mere 33 percent <a href="http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/is-concrete-more-expensive">(see chart here</a>).</p><p>The result, which city councils and county boards are painfully aware of, is that they’ve been spending more and more tax dollars to pave fewer and fewer miles of road.</p><p>While most cities and counties will require their engineering departments to seek competitive bids for the work to be done, <em>many won’t think to require an alternative design component to the competitive bidding process</em>.</p><p>As the cost between asphalt and concrete narrows, that could prove to be shortsighted. The alternative design components allow elected officials to compare the real, long-term costs of using asphalt or concrete. In other words, it allows them to compare apples-to-apples in and apples-and-oranges bidding environment.</p><p>Elsewhere in Minnesota, cities and counties are showing great returns on their decision to include the alternative design model into the bidding process. One 3.3-mile concrete overlay project in Southern Minnesota showed a savings of $275,000 over the projected life cycle of the road. That’s more than $80,000 per mile saved.</p><p>Competitive bidding in and of itself should stimulate competition and result in better overall pricing – especially when one factors in maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the road. By giving both asphalt and concrete contractors a shot at the work, Minnesotans can expect a higher return on our investment.</p><p>If you&#8217;re an elected official, ask your engineer for a life cycle analysis. If you&#8217;re a citizen, email this blog post to your city or county representative.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/alternative-pavement-design">Request alternative designs for street projects</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com">Bye Bye Potholes</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/alternative-pavement-design/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments></item><item><title>Duluth street reconstruction project a model for state</title><link>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/street-reconstruction-project</link><comments>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/street-reconstruction-project#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 14:38:38 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renee McGivern]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://byebyepotholes.com/?p=500</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Editor&#8217;s note: Here&#8217;s an Op-ed in the Duluth News Tribune from our own Fred Corrigan about a major street reconstruction project that&#8217;s being discussed in Duluth.

Unlike many other cities, however, Duluth’s mayor and City Council members have taken an aggressive, proactive approach in their fight to fix, maintain and even improve crumbling streets.</p><p>An estimated 15 to 20 miles of city streets are being fixed each year. That’s quite an accomplishment for a community that once considered five miles of road repairs a good year. And this at a time when the city is dealing with the loss of about $6 million it once received through a casino revenue-sharing agreement with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.</p><p>Duluth is to be commended for its efforts to maintain and improve city streets and infrastructure. One project, in particular, the planned reconstruction of Superior Street from Sixth Avenue West to Fourth Avenue East, may very well serve as a model for other cities and counties.</p><p>Running through the heart of downtown, Superior Street is one of Duluth’s oldest streets and is a major connector for commerce and tourism. Each day more than 11,000 vehicles travel over the brick pavers that have donned the street for more than 20 years. In 2013, portions of the brick were removed and replaced with asphalt due to deterioration. At that time, city officials said the temporary solution was initiated with the understanding that a long-term design process would be taken, and the public was encouraged to be involved.</p><p>Since then, five public hearings were held with well over 100 people attending each meeting. At least one more public meeting I’m aware of is scheduled before a final plan emerges.</p><p>The city no doubt has had to consider competing interests each step of the way, including parking needs, pedestrian use and traffic flow. And it’s heartening to know city leaders have listened to the people who have taken the time to participate in the process and offer their feedback on proposed design alternatives.</p><p>Current plans call for diagonal parking on the upper side of Superior Street and parallel parking on the lower side. And, to make the streetscape more inviting for people, the city has looked to provide space for outdoor dining, trees, shrubs, flowers, benches and public art. Below the surface, the existing water and sewer lines, first installed in the 1880s and 1890s, will be replaced. Above ground, those bricks probably will be replaced by a brighter decorative concrete design.</p><p>With proper maintenance, it should be another 40 years before the city will have to tackle another Superior Street reconstruction project.</p><p>The city’s transparency throughout this whole process has been commendable. In addition to encouraging public participation, city leaders have been diligent in their efforts to keep the public fully abreast as the project develops.</p><p>Visitors to the project’s website — duluthmn.gov/planning/superior-street — can find project presentations, summaries of each public hearing, survey results and even a compilation of individual responses to questionnaires about the project.</p><p>While the overall price tag of the street’s reconstruction, including the utility infrastructure below, could be as much as $20 million, once completed, the project will properly showcase downtown Duluth to residents and visitors.</p><p>And those first impressions do matter in a city that boasts about 3.5 million tourists each year with an estimated economic impact of $780 million.</p><p>In his 2011 State of the City speech, Mayor Don Ness talked about the importance of investing in the city’s streets and infrastructure and the cost of failing to do so.<br />“Decades of pinching pennies on infrastructure now forces us to spend massive amounts of tax dollars to do nothing more than provide an emergency patch,” he said. “After decades of neglect, we are now paying the price.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Ness was right. Decades of neglect are forcing many Minnesota cities to turn to quick fixes or pavement alternatives that cost less initially but are not as long-lasting and may result in more costs in the long run.<br />That’s just one more reason to admire the Superior Street reconstruction project. City officials aren’t looking for a quick fix; they’re looking for a long-term, concrete solution to their transportation infrastructure needs.</p><p>Well done, Duluth.</p><p><em>Questions? Comments?

But when potholes damage cars, municipalities make it much harder to seek reimbursement.</p><p>Existing laws don’t make reimbursement easy either. Here, authorities are only responsible for pothole damage if they’ve been notified about the pothole and didn’t fix it within a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>Whether it’s the process for seeking reimbursement or the laws themselves, Minnesota <a href="http://www.startribune.com/in-minnesota-pothole-claims-rarely-get-paid/202871441" target="_blank">transportation officials say it’s extremely rare for a claim to be paid</a>.</p><p>A recent <a href="http://www.independentagent.com/News/PressReleases/Pages/2014/TC06192014_Potholes.aspx" target="_blank">insurance industry survey</a> backs that up. The Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America found that that just 3 percent who sought reimbursement were able to get local authorities to pick up the tab and of the people who filed an insurance claim, over half paid out of pocket.</p><p><strong>How much?</strong></p><p>Deteriorating roads nationwide cost the average driver $515 in extra operational and maintenance costs on their cars, according to the latest analysis from TRIP, a national research group.</p><p>Or as a report in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/25/why-driving-on-americas-roads-can-be-more-expensive-than-you-think" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> put it: Those cracks and potholes put a lot of extra wear and tear on your car. They wear your tires away faster, and they decrease your gas mileage too.</p><p>And, according to the insurance industry survey, half of car owners in the U.S. say they’ve had damage done to their car because of a pothole over the last five years. That group put the price tag at $27 million for the same time period.</p><p>To the unsuspecting motorists, one could say the numbers translate into highway robbery.</p><p>Perhaps it’s time for the government entities responsible for the repair and maintenance of our roadways to pay up.</p><p>Current policies – at the local, state and national levels – provide few fiscal incentives for our elected officials to resolve our transportation funding issues. While there is widespread agreement that our roads are deteriorating faster they can be maintained, there is little agreement on how to best fund and manage the transportation system.</p><p>Maybe it’s time for taxpayers to up the ante in this decades-old debate about where the money to fix our roads should come from by requiring cities, counties, townships and the state to reimburse motorists for actual damages caused by poor road maintenance.</p><p>If each of the more 3.3 million drivers in Minnesota, submitted claims for damages and the extra maintenance and operational costs, the price tag could easily exceed $1.5 billion annually.</p><p>Facing those added expenses, perhaps <a href="http://byebyepotholes.com/pothole-solutions" target="_blank">our elected officials</a> would finally get the message: Let’s say goodbye to the potholes and fix our broken transportation system.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/potholes-damage-cars">Potholes damage cars but motorists rarely reimbursed</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com">Bye Bye Potholes</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/potholes-damage-cars/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments></item><item><title>Kittson County dedicates new Veterans Memorial</title><link>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/kittson-county-veterans-memorial</link><comments>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/kittson-county-veterans-memorial#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 20:47:31 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Renee McGivern]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://byebyepotholes.com/?p=473</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>On June 14 this year, the Kittson County Veterans Memorial was dedicated in front of a crowd of more than 450 people.

This is as thorough an investigative story as you&#8217;ll ever find. What&#8217;s really happening with pothole repairs in your community?</em></p><p>The hole in the street was not only deep, it was camouflaged with newly laid asphalt. It was easy to imagine one of the many North End residents and tourists walking down the narrow street next to the Paul Revere Mall, stepping into it and spraining their ankle – or worse.</p><p>Boston’s Public Works Interim Commissioner Michael Dennehy, his deputy, Michael Brohel, and a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office had just been to the street to show reporters how crews repair potholes. But about an hour and a half after they filled this one, it had <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2167225-tileston_necir_photo.html">caved in</a>. The bottom was only visible with a flashlight.</p><p>It turns out, Boston has a habit of implying potholes have been fixed when they haven’t, according to an examination by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting of the city system called <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/DoIT/apps/citizensconnect.asp">Citizens Connect</a> – an award-winning mobile app and website meant to increase transparency and accountability in government. A sampling of 78 cases found nearly half reported closed did not meet the city guidelines for fixing potholes.</p><p>“That’s unacceptable,” Dennehy said. “I think we need to revisit how we close cases.”</p><p>Despite repeated requests to interview Dennehy to discuss findings at his office, where he would have access to records, the mayor’s office would only agree to an interview with NECIR and its reporting partner, <a href="http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Holes-in-the-System-318231951.html">New England Cable News</a>, outside and next to a pothole being repaired.</p><p>About an hour and a half later, after the interview, NECIR and NECN reporters walked past one of the potholes the crews had just filled. It had caved in at least a foot.</p><p>Charlie Frates, 48, who lives in Acushnet and was doing construction nearby, laughed in dismay as he looked at the large cave-in.</p><p>“If I did work like that for my company, I’d be fired,” he said.</p><p>Crews came back and repaired the pothole again, this time ensuring its depths were filled.</p><p>After the record snowfall this year, potholes pepper many city roads, making walking, biking and driving a sometimes treacherous proposition.</p><p>The city says it engages with constituents and fixes potholes with efficiency and ease, thanks to Citizens Connect. But some of the potholes city workers mark as fixed are still dangerous. On several days in May, June and July, NECIR examined 78 pothole cases recently reported closed and found 18 had not been repaired. In 22 other cases, crews had filled a pothole but left others untouched at the same location – a direct violation of city protocol, explained Dennehy. Workers are expected to fix all the potholes at a particular location, he said, not just the one that was reported.</p><p>In response to NECIR’s questions, Dennehy ordered a meeting of supervisors on July 15 to discuss flaws in the system. Despite the issues, he said, he has confidence in his staff. He said he thinks the pothole reporting system works well the majority of the time.</p><p>Pothole maintenance is a source of pride for the city. In Mayor Martin Walsh’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2167204-state_of_the_city_2015.html#document/p3/a227410">State of the City</a> address in January, he said: “We paved more than 60 miles of roads [in 2014] and filled over 19,000 potholes – 50% more than in 2013.” The Boston Globe later <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/12/potholes-count-does-counting-them/eP0jqKHac7wz0lGIU0sgYM/story.html">reported</a> that these numbers were questionable.</p><p>Read the full article: <a href="http://necir.org/2015/07/22/holes-in-the-system">Holes in the System: Boston boasts pothole fixes that don&#8217;t get made</a>.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/boston-pothole-repairs">Boston pothole repairs investigated by journalists</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://byebyepotholes.com">Bye Bye Potholes</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://byebyepotholes.com/blog/boston-pothole-repairs/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments></item> </channel></rss>
